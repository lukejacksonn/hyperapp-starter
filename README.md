# hyperapp-pwa
> A minimalist starter for hyperapp projects

Once you have cloned or forked this project, use the following tasks from the project root:

```
npm install   // Install all dependencies
npm start     // Serve app on localhost and watch source files
```

This will build the application and serve it on http://localhost:8080
